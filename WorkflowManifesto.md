# Workflow Manifesto
In this document is the agreement on our way of working.

## Git
- All changes will be made on relevant feature branches and then merged to dev via pull request
- All pull requests must contain the information required by the default template
- All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one external member
  - Pull request reviews must ensure that the file changed list in the pull request alligns with the request
  - Pull request reviews should also do a surface level evaluation of the code contents of a pr
- If you find a bug, please create an issue with repro steps

## Attendance
- We are all here on all on site days (Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at the time of writing)
- Everybody is expected to be here from 9:30 onwards for on site days

## Planning
- We use Trello in order to manage tasks and deadlines
- We try to make trello tasks as small as possible, they should be undestandable from the title alone
- We have due dates on trello tasks, these will be used to check on progress in meetings so try to adhere to them
  - in the event of it not being possible to meet a deadline, don't stress, just explain why it is delayed and what the new deadline should be
